        "top_review": "I was a little nervous ordering a TV from Amazon after seeing some reviews about cracked screens, but mine arrived in perfect condition! I upgraded from an old 55” 2011 Sony Bravia and wanted a 65”, so I did a lot of research before choosing this Samsung, and I’m so glad I did. The picture quality and colors are amazing, and the TV itself is so much thinner and lighter than my old one. It connected easily via Bluetooth to my 2014 surround sound and subwoofer, and paired seamlessly with my Apple TV. It also has tons of built-in apps if I ever want to stream directly without using my Apple TV. The TV looks amazing so far, I’m just waiting for my new swivel stand to come in before I take the plastic off. Overall, I’m super happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quality upgrade at a great price. I hope this TV lasts as long as my last!",

I thought I would be confident and a good idea to get another one to replace the old and I did. it exceeded all my expectations. With great TV clarity and color, awesome adjustable options and movie apps. Really tons of great stuff and works excellent on an air antenna. Can’t be beat for sure. Should last a long time. I highly recommend it.",

        "top_review": "Editing my review from two stars to 5 stars. Very impressive that Amazon actually reads these reviews and seriously cares about how we like their products.  Since I posted the original review a very nice, very knowledgeable, tech support lady called me to work my problem of Apps not loading or playing on my FireTV.  Basically it boiled down to my new TV needing a software update. I absolutely thought this TV was plug and play, but it wasn't. Just like with any new device I guess everything needs a software update to work properly.  The wonderful tech support lady was on the phone with me over an hour,  she step by step walked me through everything. We updated all the software and now my FireTV works PERFECT!  All my news Apps and weather apps load without a problem.  The TV is no longer sluggish.  It's all fast and Perfect!  So, the next FireTV I order, and there will be more because this is an excellent value for the price, I will know to update the software before logging in or loading any apps! Thank you Amazon for truly caring about your customers 😊Seriously hate this TV. It's been a HUGE source of frustration for 3 weeks, ever since I hung it on my wall.  The picture is great. Sound is great. Remote is great, but the operating system is awful.  It WILL NOT load certain Apps, mainly Fox News and Fox Weather and other Apps are sluggish. I know it's not a problem with the App because when I tested them on our living room TV (different brand with Roku hooked up) at the same time, they load perfectly,  so I know it's just this TV.  I LOVE Amazon and really wanted to love this TV, but I just don't.  Daily I have to end up clearing my caches for all the Apps and unplugging the TV for one minute to reset the TV, if I want to watch either of those two Apps.  Super frustrating.  I still have about another week to return this TV, but I'm concerned if I order another one will I have the exact same problem?  If anyone at Amazon Tech support has any ideas why just these two Apps will not load please reach out to me!",
